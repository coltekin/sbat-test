# SBAT
A simple browser-based annotation tool.  

28.07.2024 - Current limitations / bugs:  
1. cannot select branch
2. can only open file in the first level of file tree (login -> folder -> file)
3. after deletion, error in commit "Error creating new commit: TypeError: cyclic object value"
4. cannot delete events
5. when using github API to get repo, use Person Access Token owner as the repo owner (may not able to get the repo created by other people)  

Keeping annotation interface in start page:  
- to be able to test config without need of logging in

Comments, error handling
